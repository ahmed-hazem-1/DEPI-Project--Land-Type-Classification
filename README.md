## **1. Project Proposal**  

### **Overview:**  
This project leverages **Deep Neural Networks (DNNs)** to classify different land types (**agriculture, water, urban areas, desert, roads, trees**) using **Sentinel-2 satellite images** from the **EuroSAT dataset**. The goal is to develop a **DNN-based model** that accurately classifies land types, supporting applications in **urban planning, environmental monitoring, and resource management**.  

### **Objectives:**  
- **Data Collection & Processing:** Gather and preprocess satellite imagery data.  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Understand and preprocess Sentinel-2 satellite images.  
- **Model Selection, Development & Training:** Build and optimize a **DNN/CNN model** for classification.  
- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Improve model performance using **transfer learning** and tuning.  
- **Dashboard Development:** Create a **Power BI dashboard** to visualize classification results.  
- **Deployment & Monitoring:** Deploy the model using **Flask/FastAPI** and set up monitoring.  
- **GitHub README & Presentation:** Document the project and present findings.  

### **Scope:**  
- **In-Scope:**  
  - Data collection, preprocessing, and deep learning model implementation.  
  - Developing an interactive Power BI dashboard.  
  - Model deployment and monitoring.  

- **Out-of-Scope:**  
  - Real-time satellite image retrieval.  
  - Advanced geospatial analytics beyond land classification.
