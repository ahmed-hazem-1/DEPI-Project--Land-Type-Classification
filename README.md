# Land Type Classification using Sentinel-2 Satellite Images

## Project Overview

The **Land Type Classification using Sentinel-2 Satellite Images** project leverages **Deep Neural Networks (DNNs)** to classify various land types based on satellite imagery from the European Space Agencyâ€™s Sentinel-2 mission. The main land types targeted for classification include:

- Agriculture
- Water
- Urban areas
- Desert
- Roads
- Trees

Sentinel-2 provides free, high-resolution multispectral images, making it an ideal resource for land use classification. The primary objective of this project is to develop a DNN model that accurately classifies these land types, enabling applications in:

- **Urban Planning**
- **Environmental Monitoring**
- **Resource Management**

### Key Features
- Utilization of Sentinel-2 multispectral imagery.
- Application of state-of-the-art DNN architectures for image classification.
- Support for open-source datasets and the ability to generate custom datasets using tools like **QGIS**.

### Goals
- Create a reliable and efficient DNN-based classification model.
- Provide actionable insights for stakeholders in urban development, environmental conservation, and other domains.

### Tools and Technologies
- **Deep Neural Networks (DNNs):** For building and training the classification model.
- **Sentinel-2 Data:** High-resolution, multispectral satellite images.
- **QGIS:** For generating and managing custom datasets.
- **Python:** The primary programming language for data processing and model development.
- **TensorFlow/PyTorch:** Frameworks for implementing DNNs.

### Applications
1. **Urban Planning:** Identify urban growth patterns and optimize land use.
2. **Environmental Monitoring:** Track deforestation, waterbody changes, and desertification.
3. **Resource Management:** Optimize agricultural practices and natural resource utilization.
